The main focus of a customer with a health-conscious mindset is on organic and low-fat items, with a specific interest in fruits and vegetables rather than meats or seafood. This customer follows a predetermined list to ensure their dietary habits are maintained, and they are willing to spend money on high-quality products, particularly those that are fresh and organic.
