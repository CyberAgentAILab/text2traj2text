The customer's main objective is to purchase items suitable for gifting. They tend to choose chocolates, wines, and gourmet items for this purpose. The customer usually follows a predetermined list and actively looks for specific items that would make ideal gifts. Quality and presentation take precedence over price, leading them to prefer premium items with appealing packaging. Cooking a specific dish is not their primary focus; instead, they prioritize selecting items to give as gifts.
