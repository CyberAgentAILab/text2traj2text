The customer usually follows a predetermined list and actively looks for specific items that would make ideal gifts. Quality and presentation are more important to them than price, leading them to prefer premium items with appealing packaging. Cooking a specific dish is not their main focus; instead, they prioritize selecting items to give as gifts.
