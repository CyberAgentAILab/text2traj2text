When it comes to purchasing gifts, this customer's main goal is to find chocolates, wines, and gourmet items. They usually have a predetermined list and actively search for specific items that make great gifts. Quality and presentation are more important to them than price, so they often choose premium items that come in attractive packaging. Cooking a specific dish is not their primary focus; instead, they concentrate on selecting items to give as gifts.
