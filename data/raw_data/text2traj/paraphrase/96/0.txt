The customer, who focuses on purchasing items for gifts, typically buys chocolates, wines, and gourmet products. They have a predetermined list and often search for specific items that make great gifts. Quality and presentation are more important to them than price, so they often choose premium items with attractive packaging. Cooking specific dishes is not their priority; instead, they concentrate on selecting items to give as gifts.
