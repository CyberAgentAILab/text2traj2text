Preparations are underway for a major gathering organized by a party planner. The customer typically arrives with a pre-planned list of purchases, buying in bulk to ensure there's enough for a large number of guests. The customer seeks discounted, high-quality goods and prefers a combination of fresh and pre-prepared items. The intention is to serve a diverse selection of dishes at the party.
