A customer who is committed to fitness and gives utmost importance to protein-rich foods and dietary supplements arrives with a fixed list of purchases. The customer's main focus is on buying meat, dairy, and grains, while making it a point to avoid sugary and high-fat items. Quality is a priority for the customer, and they are not much concerned about discounts. Additionally, they prefer purchasing fresh and unprocessed items.
