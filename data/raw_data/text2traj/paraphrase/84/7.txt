A customer who focuses on budget constraints looks for discounted items and sales. They often purchase non-perishable items in bulk and do not have a predetermined list while shopping. Their decisions are influenced by the best available deals. This customer places more importance on price than quality and frequently chooses lower-quality items to save money. They prefer cooking meals that are simple and affordable.
