A customer who is conscious of their budget focuses on discounted items and sales. They often purchase non-perishable items in bulk and do not follow a predetermined list while shopping. Instead, they make decisions based on the best deals available. This customer prioritizes price over quality and frequently chooses lower-quality items to save money. They prefer cooking meals that are simple and affordable.
