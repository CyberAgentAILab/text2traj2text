A customer who focuses on budget constraints looks for discounted items and sales. They frequently purchase non-perishable items in bulk and do not have a predetermined list while shopping. Instead, they base their decisions on finding the best deals. This customer places more importance on price than quality and often chooses lower-quality items to save money. They prefer cooking meals that are simple and affordable.
