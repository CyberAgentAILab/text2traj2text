A customer who pays attention to their budget focuses on discounted items and sales. They tend to purchase non-perishable items in bulk and do not follow a predetermined list while shopping. Instead, they make decisions based on the best deals available. This customer prioritizes price over quality and often chooses lower-quality items to save money. They prefer cooking simple and affordable meals.
