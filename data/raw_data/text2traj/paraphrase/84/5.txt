A customer who is conscious of their budget focuses on discounted items and sales. They tend to purchase non-perishable items in bulk and do not follow a predetermined shopping list. Instead, they make decisions based on the best available deals. This customer prioritizes price over quality and often chooses lower-quality products to save money. They prefer cooking meals that are both simple and affordable.
