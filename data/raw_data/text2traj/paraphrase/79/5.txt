A customer's main objective is to achieve cost-effectiveness through bulk purchases. They usually opt for larger quantities of staple foods, meats, and vegetables. When shopping, they have a predetermined list that caters to their various needs. Quantity and price are prioritized over quality, and they often seek discounts on bulk purchases. In addition, the customer prefers purchasing whole ingredients to cook large meals.
