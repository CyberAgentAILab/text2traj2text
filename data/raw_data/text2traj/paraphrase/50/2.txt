A health-conscious individual who prioritizes organic and locally sourced produce is the customer in question. They usually arrive at the store with a pre-determined list, giving preference to fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains. This customer avoids meat and processed foods while being willing to pay a higher price for top-quality items. Their usual shopping pattern involves purchasing only a small number of items during each visit.
