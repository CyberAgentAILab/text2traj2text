The customer we are referring to is health-conscious and values organic and locally sourced produce. They typically arrive at the store with a pre-arranged list, giving priority to fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains. This customer avoids meat and processed foods while being willing to pay a higher price for high-quality items. Typically, they purchase only a small number of items during each visit.
