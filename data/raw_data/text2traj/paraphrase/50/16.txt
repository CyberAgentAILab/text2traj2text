The customer we are referring to is health-conscious and shows a preference for organic and locally sourced produce. On their visits, they bring a pre-selected list, prioritizing fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains. They avoid purchasing meat and processed foods, instead opting for high-quality items. This customer is willing to pay more for fresh, unprocessed goods and usually buys a small number of items per visit.
