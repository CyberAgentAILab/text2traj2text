An environmentally conscious customer who values their health prefers organic and locally sourced produce. When they come to the store, they usually have a predetermined list that includes fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains. This customer avoids purchasing meat and processed foods and is willing to pay a premium for high-quality, fresh, unprocessed items. Typically, they only buy a few items per visit.
