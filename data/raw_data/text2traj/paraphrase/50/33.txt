A customer concerned about their health and well-being prefers organic and locally sourced produce. They usually arrive at the store with a predetermined list of items, giving priority to fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains. This customer consciously avoids buying meat and processed foods while being willing to pay a premium for high-quality items. Typically, they purchase only a few items during each visit.
