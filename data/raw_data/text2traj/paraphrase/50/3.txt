The customer we are referring to is health-conscious and specifically looks for organic and locally sourced produce. On their visits, they bring a list of items they want to purchase, with fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy, and grains being their top priorities. Meat and processed foods are avoided, and they are willing to pay more for high-quality products. Typically, this customer buys a limited number of items during each visit.
