An environmentally aware customer emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendliness when making purchases. They usually arrive with a pre-established shopping list that includes organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and cleaning products that are gentle on the environment. This customer is willing to pay extra for products that align with their values and favors unprocessed goods.
