A customer who is conscious about the environment and sustainability places great importance on purchasing eco-friendly products. Typically, this customer arrives with a predetermined shopping list that consists of items such as organic fruits and vegetables, fair-trade coffee, and cleaning products that are environmentally friendly. They are willing to pay a higher price for products that match their values and have a preference for unprocessed goods.
