A customer who is aware of their environmental impact emphasizes sustainability and eco-friendly products. When they visit, they often have a predetermined list of purchases, including organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and eco-friendly cleaning products. The customer is willing to pay a higher price for products that reflect their values and favors unprocessed goods.
