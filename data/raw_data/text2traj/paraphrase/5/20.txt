An environmentally conscious customer gives priority to sustainability and eco-friendly products. Typically, they come with a pre-established shopping list that includes organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and eco-friendly cleaning products. The customer is willing to pay more for products that are in line with their values and prefers unprocessed goods.
