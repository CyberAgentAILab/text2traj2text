An environmentally aware customer prioritizes sustainable and eco-friendly products. When they visit, they often have a predetermined list of purchases, including organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and environmentally friendly cleaning products. The customer is willing to pay extra for products that align with their values and favors unprocessed goods.
