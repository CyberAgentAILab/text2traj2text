A customer who is environmentally conscious places a high importance on sustainable and eco-friendly products. Typically, this customer arrives with a pre-planned shopping list that consists of items like organic fruits and vegetables, fair-trade coffee, and cleaning products that are kind to the environment. They are willing to pay more for products that reflect their values and have a preference for unprocessed goods.
