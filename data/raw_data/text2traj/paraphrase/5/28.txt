A customer who is environmentally conscious values sustainability and eco-friendly products. They often come with a pre-planned shopping list that includes organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and cleaning products that are gentle on the environment. The customer is willing to pay a higher price for products that resonate with their values and has a preference for unprocessed goods.
