A customer who is environmentally conscious places great importance on sustainability and eco-friendly products. They usually come with a pre-established list of purchases, such as organic produce, fair-trade coffee, and cleaning products that are environmentally friendly. The customer is willing to spend more on products that reflect their values and prefers unprocessed goods.
