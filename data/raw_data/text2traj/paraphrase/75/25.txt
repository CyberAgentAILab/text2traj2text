The customer primarily seeks affordable and easy-to-prepare food choices. They often buy instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. When shopping, they tend to make decisions without a specific list. Quality is not their main concern; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preferred choices, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
