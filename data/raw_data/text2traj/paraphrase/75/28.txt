A customer who prioritizes affordability and convenience when it comes to food. Instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals are their go-to purchases. They usually shop without a specific list and make decisions while browsing in the store. Quality is not a major concern for them; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preferred choices, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
