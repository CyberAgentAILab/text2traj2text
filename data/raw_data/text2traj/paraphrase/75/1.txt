The customer's main focus is on finding budget-friendly and easily prepared food items. They typically buy instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. When shopping, they tend to make decisions on the spot without a predetermined list. Quality is not a major concern for them; rather, they prioritize affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preferred choices, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
