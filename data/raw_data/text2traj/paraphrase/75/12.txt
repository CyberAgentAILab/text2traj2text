A customer who prioritizes affordability and convenience in food choices. Their typical purchases include instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. They tend to shop without a specific list and make decisions spontaneously in-store. Quality is not their main focus; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preferred choices, and they don't usually have a particular dish in mind when cooking.
