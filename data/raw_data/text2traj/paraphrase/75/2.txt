A customer who prioritizes affordable and convenient food options. Their usual purchases include instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. They tend to shop spontaneously without a predetermined list and make decisions while browsing in the store. Quality is not a primary concern; instead, they focus on finding affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preference, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
