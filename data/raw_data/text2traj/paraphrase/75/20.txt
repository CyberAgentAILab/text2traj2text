A customer who seeks affordable and convenient food options. They often buy instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. When shopping, they tend to make decisions without a predetermined list. Quality is not their primary concern; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preference, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
