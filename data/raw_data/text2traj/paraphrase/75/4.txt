A customer who seeks out affordable and convenient food options. They frequently purchase instant noodles, canned goods, and frozen meals. When shopping, they usually don't have a specific list and make their decisions on the spot. Quality is not their main concern; instead, they prioritize affordability. They prefer ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items and don't usually have a particular dish in mind when cooking.
