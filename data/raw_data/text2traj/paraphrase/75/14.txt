A customer who seeks out affordable and convenient food options. They frequently purchase instant noodles, canned goods, and frozen meals. When shopping, they usually don't have a specific shopping list and make decisions spontaneously. Quality is not a top priority for them; instead, they focus on finding affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preference, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
