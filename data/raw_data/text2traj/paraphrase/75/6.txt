A customer who places emphasis on affordability and simplicity in food choices. They frequently purchase instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. Their shopping style involves making decisions in-store without a predetermined list. Quality is not their main concern; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. They prefer ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items and do not have a particular dish in mind when cooking.
