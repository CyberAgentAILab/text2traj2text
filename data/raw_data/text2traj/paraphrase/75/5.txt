The customer primarily focuses on finding affordable and easy-to-prepare food items. They often buy instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. When shopping, they tend to make spontaneous decisions without a predetermined list. Quality is not a high priority for them; instead, they value affordable prices. Ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items are their preferred choices, and they don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
