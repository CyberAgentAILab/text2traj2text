The customer's primary interest lies in affordable and easily prepared food choices. They typically buy items like instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. They have a tendency to shop without a predefined shopping list and often decide what to purchase while in the store. Quality is not a significant factor for this customer; instead, they prioritize finding affordable prices. They favor ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items and don't have a specific dish in mind when cooking.
