A customer who prioritizes affordability and simplicity in food choices. They frequently purchase instant noodles, canned food, and frozen meals. They tend to shop spontaneously without a predetermined list and make decisions in-store. Quality is not their primary concern; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. They prefer ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items and do not have a particular dish in mind when cooking.
