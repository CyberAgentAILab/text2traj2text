A customer who focuses on affordable and convenient food options, such as instant noodles, canned goods, and frozen meals. They tend to shop without a specific shopping list and make decisions in-store. Quality is not a top priority for this customer; instead, they prioritize affordable prices. They prefer ready-to-eat or easy-to-cook items and do not have a particular dish in mind when cooking.
