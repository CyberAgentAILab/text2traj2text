A customer who values traditional cooking methods generally creates a shopping list that includes fresh produce, meat, and dairy products. They are often drawn to discounted items but never compromise on the quality of their purchases. Their preference is for unseasoned, unprocessed foods, and they usually shop with a specific traditional recipe in mind.
