A customer who values traditional cooking usually has a list of items to buy, which typically includes fresh produce, meat, and dairy. The customer is often interested in discounted items but never compromises on the quality of their purchases. They prefer unseasoned, unprocessed foods and usually shop with a specific traditional recipe in mind.
