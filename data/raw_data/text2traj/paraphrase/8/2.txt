The customer is someone who places a great deal of importance on traditional cooking. Their shopping list usually consists of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products. They are often drawn to discounted items but never compromise on the quality of their purchases. They prefer unseasoned, unprocessed foods and usually shop with a specific traditional recipe in mind.
