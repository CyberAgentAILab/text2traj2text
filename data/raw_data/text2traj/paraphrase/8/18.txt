The customer is an individual who values traditional cooking methods and usually creates a list of items to purchase, such as fresh produce, meat, and dairy. They are often attracted to discounted items but never compromise on the quality of their purchases. Their preference is for unseasoned, unprocessed foods, and they usually shop with a specific traditional recipe in mind.
