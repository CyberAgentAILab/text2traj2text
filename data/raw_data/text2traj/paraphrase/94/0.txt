A person who adheres to a specific diet, such as keto or paleo, focuses on purchasing items that align with their dietary requirements. They prioritize buying high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. They always shop with a prepared list to ensure they stay committed to their diet. Price is not their primary concern; they are more inclined to buy specialty items that suit their diet. They take pleasure in cooking meals that are tailored to their chosen diet, often preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
