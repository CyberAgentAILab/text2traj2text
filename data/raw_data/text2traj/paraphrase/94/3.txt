A person who follows a particular diet, such as keto or paleo, focuses on selecting items that meet their dietary preferences. They specifically buy high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. By shopping with a predetermined list, they stay committed to their chosen diet. The customer's priority is finding diet-friendly options rather than considering the price, often purchasing specialty items that fit their diet. They take pleasure in cooking meals that align with their diet, frequently preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
