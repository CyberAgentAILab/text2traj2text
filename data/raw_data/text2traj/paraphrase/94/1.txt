A diet follower pays close attention to selecting products that are compatible with their specific dietary needs, such as keto or paleo. They primarily purchase high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. By always shopping with a predetermined list, they maintain their commitment to their diet. The customer's priority lies in finding items that fit their diet rather than focusing on price, often opting for specialty products. Cooking meals that align with their diet brings them joy, and they frequently prepare keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
