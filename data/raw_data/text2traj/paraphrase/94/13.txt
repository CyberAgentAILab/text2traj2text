A customer who adheres to a specific diet, such as keto or paleo, focuses on purchasing items that align with their dietary needs. They mainly buy high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. By shopping with a prepared list, they ensure they stay committed to their diet. The customer's priority lies in finding diet-compatible options rather than considering the price, often opting for specialty items that suit their diet. They take pleasure in cooking meals that cater to their chosen diet, frequently preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
