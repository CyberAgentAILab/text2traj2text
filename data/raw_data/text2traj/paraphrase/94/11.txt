A customer who follows a specific diet, such as keto or paleo, pays attention to purchasing items that fit their dietary preferences. They primarily buy high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. They always shop with a prepared list to ensure they stay on track with their diet. The customer's focus is on finding diet-compatible options rather than considering the price, often opting for specialty items that suit their diet. They take pleasure in cooking meals that align with their diet, frequently preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
