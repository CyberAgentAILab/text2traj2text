A person on a specific diet, such as keto or paleo, concentrates on buying items that are suitable for their dietary restrictions. They mainly buy high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. By shopping with a pre-determined list, they ensure they remain faithful to their chosen diet. The customer places greater importance on diet compatibility than price, often opting for specialty items that fit their diet. They take pleasure in cooking diet-specific meals, typically preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
