A person who follows a particular diet, such as keto or paleo, focuses on selecting items that meet their dietary preferences. They primarily buy high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. By shopping with a prepared list, they ensure they stick to their diet plan. The customer's priority is finding diet-friendly options rather than considering the price, often choosing specialty items that suit their specific diet. They enjoy cooking meals tailored to their diet, frequently preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
