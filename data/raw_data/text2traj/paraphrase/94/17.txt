A diet adherent primarily seeks out products that align with their specific diet, such as keto or paleo. They usually purchase high-fat foods for a keto diet or unprocessed foods for a paleo diet. Their shopping trips involve following a prepared list to maintain their diet. The customer's focus is on finding diet-compatible options rather than considering the price, often opting for specialty items that suit their dietary needs. They derive satisfaction from cooking meals that cater to their chosen diet, frequently preparing keto-friendly or paleo-friendly dishes.
