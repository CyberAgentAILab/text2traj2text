The customer is a busy individual who values convenience and quick meals. They typically purchase ready-to-eat meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food products. They don't follow a fixed shopping list and instead make impulsive decisions based on what appeals to them. Their top priority is saving time in the kitchen, so they prioritize convenience over price or quality. They usually rely on ready-made meals rather than cooking a particular dish.
