A busy customer who values convenience and quick meals. Their usual purchases include pre-made meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food items. They don't have a fixed shopping list and tend to decide on products based on visual appeal. Their main priority is convenience, and they prioritize time-saving options in the kitchen. Cooking a specific dish is not their preference, as they rely on ready-to-eat meals.
