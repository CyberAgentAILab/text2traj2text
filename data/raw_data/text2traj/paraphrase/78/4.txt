The customer is a busy individual who seeks convenience and quick meals. They often buy ready-made meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food items. Instead of having a set shopping list, they make decisions based on what catches their attention. Convenience is their top priority, and they prioritize time-saving options in the kitchen. They generally prefer ready-to-eat meals rather than cooking a specific dish.
