The customer is a busy individual who values convenience and quick meals. They typically purchase ready-to-eat meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food products. They don't follow a fixed shopping list and instead make spontaneous decisions based on what catches their attention. Their main priority is time-saving in the kitchen, so they prioritize convenience over price or quality. They usually depend on ready-made meals rather than cooking a particular dish.
