A customer who is occupied with work and values convenience and quick meals. Their usual purchases include pre-made meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food items. They don't stick to a fixed shopping list and tend to choose products based on visual appeal. The customer's priority is convenience, and they prioritize time-saving options in the kitchen. Cooking a specific dish is not their preference, as they rely on ready-to-eat meals.
