A customer who is occupied with work and values convenience and quick meals. Their typical purchases consist of pre-made meals, packaged salads, and microwaveable food items. They don't adhere to a fixed shopping list and tend to select products based on visual appeal. Convenience is their main concern, and they prioritize time-saving options in the kitchen. Cooking a specific dish is not their preference, as they rely on ready-to-eat meals.
