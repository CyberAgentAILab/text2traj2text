The customer can be characterized as an impulse buyer who is attracted to items that catch their eye. They typically purchase a mix of products, frequently influenced by special deals, attractive packaging, or the introduction of new items. When shopping, they don't have a predetermined list and instead make spontaneous choices based on what they see in the store. Price and quality are not their top priorities, as they often make impulse purchases and appreciate the diversity of items they buy on a whim.
