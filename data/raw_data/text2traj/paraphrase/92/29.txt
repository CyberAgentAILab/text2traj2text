The customer can be classified as an impulse buyer who is easily captivated by visually appealing merchandise. They have a habit of purchasing a variety of items, often swayed by special offers, attractive packaging, or the introduction of new products. Their shopping trips are unplanned, as they don't have a predetermined list and instead make spontaneous choices based on what they come across in the store. Price and quality are not their primary concerns, as they derive satisfaction from the diversity of items they buy on a whim.
