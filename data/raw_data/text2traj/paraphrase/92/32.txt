The customer can be characterized as an impulse buyer who is easily enticed by visually appealing merchandise. They tend to purchase a variety of products, often swayed by special offers, attractive packaging, or the introduction of new items. Without a predefined shopping list, they rely on spontaneous decisions when shopping, choosing items based on what they find in the store. Price and quality are not their primary concerns, as they derive satisfaction from the variety of items they buy impulsively.
