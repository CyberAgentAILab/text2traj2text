This customer is an impulsive shopper who gravitates towards items that capture their attention. They usually buy a variety of products, often influenced by special promotions, appealing packaging, or the availability of new items. Their shopping trips are unplanned, as they don't have a set list and instead make spur-of-the-moment decisions based on what appeals to them in the store. Price and quality are not their main considerations, as they enjoy the thrill of making impulse purchases and appreciate the assortment of items they acquire on a whim.
