The customer is an impulse buyer who is easily drawn to items that capture their interest. They tend to purchase a wide range of products, often swayed by special deals, attractive packaging, or the presence of new items. When shopping, they don't have a predefined list and instead make spontaneous choices based on what they encounter in the store. Price and quality are not their top priorities, as they often make impulse purchases and appreciate the assortment of items they acquire on a whim.
