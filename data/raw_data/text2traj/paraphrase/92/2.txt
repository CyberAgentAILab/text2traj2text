The customer can be categorized as an impulse buyer who is easily enticed by visually appealing merchandise. Their purchases encompass a wide range of products, frequently influenced by special promotions, eye-catching packaging, or the introduction of new items. Without a predetermined shopping list, they rely on spontaneous decisions triggered by what they come across in the store. Their buying behavior is driven by impulse rather than price or quality, and they derive satisfaction from the assortment of items they acquire on a whim.
