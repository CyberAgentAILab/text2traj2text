The customer falls into the category of impulse buyers, with a tendency to be drawn to visually appealing items. They frequently purchase a mix of products, often influenced by special promotions, attractive packaging, or the availability of new items. Their shopping trips do not involve following a predetermined list, as they make spontaneous decisions based on what they spot in the store. Price and quality are not their main considerations, as they enjoy the variety of items they purchase on a whim.
