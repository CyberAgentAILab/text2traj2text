This customer is an impulsive shopper who is drawn to visually appealing items. They have a tendency to buy different types of products, often influenced by special promotions, attractive packaging, or the availability of new items. Their shopping trips are unplanned, as they don't have a specific list and instead make spontaneous decisions based on what they encounter in the store. Price and quality are not their primary considerations, as they derive satisfaction from the diversity of items they purchase on impulse.
