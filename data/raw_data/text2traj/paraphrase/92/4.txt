The customer falls into the impulse buyer category, displaying a preference for items that capture their interest visually. They have a tendency to purchase a wide range of products, with their choices often shaped by special promotions, appealing packaging, or the introduction of new items. Rather than having a predetermined list, they make spontaneous decisions during their shopping trips, selecting items based on what they encounter in the store. Price and quality are not their main considerations, as they derive satisfaction from the variety of items they buy on a whim.
