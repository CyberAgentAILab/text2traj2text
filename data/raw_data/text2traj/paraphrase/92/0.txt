The customer is an impulse buyer who is drawn to visually appealing items. They often purchase a variety of products, influenced by special promotions, attractive packaging, or new releases. Their shopping trips are spontaneous, as they don't have a predetermined list and make decisions based on what catches their eye in the store. Price and quality are not their primary considerations, and they enjoy the excitement of buying items on a whim.
