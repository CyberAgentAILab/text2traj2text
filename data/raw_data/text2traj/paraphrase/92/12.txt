The customer is an impulsive buyer who is attracted to items that catch their eye. They typically purchase a variety of products, often influenced by special offers, attractive packaging, or the introduction of new items. When shopping, they don't have a predetermined list and instead make spontaneous decisions based on what they see in the store. Price and quality are not their top priorities, as they often make impulse purchases and appreciate the variety of items they bought on a whim.
