The customer is an impulse buyer who is easily drawn to items that pique their interest. They tend to purchase a diverse range of products, often swayed by special offers, attractive packaging, or the presence of new items. Without a predetermined shopping list, they make impulsive decisions based on what catches their attention in the store. Price and quality are not their primary concerns, as they derive satisfaction from the variety of items they buy on a whim.
