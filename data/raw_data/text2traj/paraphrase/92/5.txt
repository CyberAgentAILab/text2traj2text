This customer is an impulsive buyer who is easily swayed by visually appealing merchandise. They tend to buy a diverse array of items, often influenced by special offers, attractive packaging, or the presence of new products. When they go shopping, they don't have a specific list and instead make impromptu decisions based on what grabs their attention in the store. Price and quality are not their primary concerns, as they derive enjoyment from purchasing a variety of items on impulse.
