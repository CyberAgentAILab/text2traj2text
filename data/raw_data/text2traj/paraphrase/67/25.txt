An environmentally conscious customer tends to choose products that are eco-friendly. When shopping, they typically look for organic produce, plant-based items, and products with minimal packaging. This customer favors high-end products and is willing to pay a higher price for sustainable and environmentally friendly options. Fresh and unprocessed goods are also their preference.
