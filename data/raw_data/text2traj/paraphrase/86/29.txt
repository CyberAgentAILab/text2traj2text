The party planner primarily focuses on snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically purchases a variety of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They shop with a predetermined list to ensure they have everything they need for the party. The customer gives priority to offering a diverse range of options to cater to different tastes. Cooking a specific dish is not their usual approach; instead, they prefer finger food and drinks.
