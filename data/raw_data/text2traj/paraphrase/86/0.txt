The party planner specializes in snacks, beverages, and party supplies. The customer typically buys a variety of snacks, alcoholic drinks, and party decorations. The customer follows a predetermined shopping list to ensure they have everything they need for the party. Their focus is on offering a wide range of options to cater to different tastes, prioritizing variety and quantity over quality. Cooking a specific dish is not a common practice for the customer, who prefers finger food and drinks.
