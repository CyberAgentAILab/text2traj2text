The party planner's main focus is on snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically buys a range of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They make their purchases based on a predetermined list to ensure they have all the necessary items for the party. Variety and quantity are the customer's priorities, as they aim to cater to different tastes. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual approach; finger food and drinks take precedence.
