The party planner specializes in arranging snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically buys various snacks, alcoholic beverages, and decorations for their parties. They follow a predetermined list while shopping to ensure they have everything they need. The customer values variety and quantity more than quality, often purchasing a range of items to cater to different tastes. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual practice; instead, they focus on providing finger food and drinks.
