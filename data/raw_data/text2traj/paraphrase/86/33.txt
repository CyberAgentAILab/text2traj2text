The party planner specializes in snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically purchases a variety of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They shop with a predetermined list to ensure they have everything they need for the party. The customer gives more importance to variety and quantity rather than quality, often buying a range of items to cater to different preferences. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual practice; finger food and drinks are preferred.
