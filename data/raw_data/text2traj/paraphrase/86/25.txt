The party planner's main area of expertise lies in snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically buys a selection of different snacks, alcoholic beverages, and decorations for their parties. They come prepared with a shopping list to make sure they have all the necessary items. The customer's priority is to offer a wide variety of options to accommodate different tastes. They don't typically cook specific dishes but instead focus on offering finger food and drinks.
