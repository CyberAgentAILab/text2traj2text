The party planner has a strong focus on snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer usually buys a variety of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They come prepared with a predetermined shopping list to ensure they have all the necessary items for the party. The customer's priority lies in providing a diverse range of options to cater to different tastes. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual practice; finger food and drinks take precedence.
