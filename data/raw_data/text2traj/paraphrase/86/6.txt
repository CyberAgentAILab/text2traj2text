The party planner specializes in organizing snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer usually buys an assortment of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They shop with a predefined list to ensure they have all the required items for the party. The customer values variety and quantity more than quality, often opting for a diverse range of products to cater to different preferences. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual practice; they focus on providing finger food and drinks.
