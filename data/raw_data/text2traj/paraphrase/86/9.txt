The party planner specializes in arranging snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer typically purchases a range of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and party decorations. They shop with a predetermined list to ensure they have all the necessary items for the party. The customer values variety and quantity over quality, often opting for a diverse selection of products to cater to different tastes. Cooking specific dishes is not their usual approach; they prefer finger food and drinks.
