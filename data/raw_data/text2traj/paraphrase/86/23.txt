The party planner primarily focuses on snacks, drinks, and party supplies. The customer usually buys a mix of snacks, alcoholic beverages, and decorative items for their parties. They have a predetermined shopping list to ensure they have all the necessary items. The customer's priority is to offer a diverse selection of products to cater to different tastes. They generally avoid cooking specific dishes and instead prefer to serve finger food and drinks.
